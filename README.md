# Prep-Baseball-Report
Here is the project for my Prep Baseball Report Project. I used the baseballr package to recieve the data from the baseball savant website. I stored all the data in RDATA files. The final data is located in the final_pitcher_organized for pitcher data, final_pitch_organized for the pitch data, and final_batter_organized for batter data. I read in the data in the data loading file, and in the data cleaning file I cleaned the data to make it look good and to only focus on the data that was looked for. I then created a rshiny app inside of the PBR final project. I was able to create this project on my local server and I have the code in the file, but unfortunately I have enountered issues when moving this to the server. It turns out that I need more memory to be able to use the application on the server due to the size of these dataframes that I have.
